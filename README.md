# Pi-Node-Map
Pi Node Map is a lightweight, real‑time visualization tool that displays all active peer connections of your Pi Node on an interactive world map. It automatically detects inbound and outbound TCP connections, retrieves geolocation data for each peer, and renders them as color‑coded markers and connection lines.
